## Starting Project
Starting out as
```
django-admin startproject (project name)
python manage.py startapp (app name) # I'll call it 'myApp'
```

Once I've done that, *'myApp'* directory will appear and within it multiple different files.\

Go to *settings.py* and add the name of the app within *INSTALLED_APPS*.
This will allow django to see the app.\

## Adding Page Routing
### Creating a Response
Let's add the response in *myapp/views.py*
```
from django.shortcuts import render, HttpResponse

# Create your views here.
def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello World!")
```
### Linking it to a Route
Create *myapp/url.py* that will connect the route to the corresponding function.
```
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path("foo2", views.home)
]
```
Now within *hello/urls.py*, change it to the following
```
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path("foo/", include("myapp.urls"))
]
```
Initially, there only *path('admin/', admin.site.urls)* will exist in *urlpatterns*.\
All routes going to *foo* will be now passed onto *myapp/urls.py*.

## Basic Commands
`python manage.py runserver`
