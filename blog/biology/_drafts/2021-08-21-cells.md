I've discussed prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells before.

### Eukaryotic and Prokaryotic Cells
Eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells both are enclosed in a plasma membrane, which is a selective barrier that only lets pass certain materials.\
However, eukaryotic cells have membrane-bound organelles, while prokaryotic cells do not.\

The semi-fluid that exists inside the cells (what exists in the space between organelles), is aclled *cytosol*
> cytosol = semifluid
> cytosol + organelle - nucleus = cytoplasm
Like you can see above, the cytoplasm doesn't include the nucleus.\
The opposite of cytoplasm is *nucleplasm*, the inside of the nucleus.

### Genes and Nucleus
The DNA (Deoxy Nucleic Acid) is the genetic code within a cell.\

* Prokaryotic cell: 
    - concentrated in nucleoid
    - not enclosed by membrane
* Eukaryoric cell: 
    - bound by nucleus
    - enclosed by *nuclear envelope*
    - while most of the genes are in the nucleus, while some of them are in the chloroplast and the mitochondria.

Nuclear envelope consists of a double membrane. That's 2 lipid bilayers put together.\
Picture for reference.

Now, there are pores on the nuclear envelope for the passage of materials between the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm.\
A protein structure called the *'pore complex'*, or NPC(Nuclear pore complex) for short, lines the pore and regulates the materials that are passed.\

- *Nulcear lamina*
    - Mechanical suport for nucleus by fibrillar network
    - regulates DNA replication and cell division
    - anchors the NPCs

Chromosomes are made from condensed DNA. The condensation is made possible by chromatin.
