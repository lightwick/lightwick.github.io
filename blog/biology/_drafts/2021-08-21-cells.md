### Eukaryotic and Prokaryotic Cells
Eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells both are enclosed in a plasma membrane, which is a selective barrier that only lets pass certain materials.\
However, eukaryotic cells have membrane-bound organelles, while prokaryotic cells do not.\

The semi-fluid that exists inside the cells (what exists in the space between organelles), is aclled *cytosol*
> cytosol = semifluid
> cytosol + organelle - nucleus = cytoplasm
Like you can see above, the cytoplasm doesn't include the nucleus.\
The opposite of cytoplasm is *nucleplasm*, the inside of the nucleus.

### Genes and Nucleus
The DNA (Deoxy Nucleic Acid) is the genetic code within a cell.\

* Prokaryotic cell: 
    - concentrated in nucleoid
    - not enclosed by membrane
* Eukaryoric cell: 
    - bound by nucleus
    - enclosed by *nuclear envelope*
    - while most of the genes are in the nucleus, while some of them are in the chloroplast and the mitochondria.

Nuclear envelope consists of a double membrane. That's 2 lipid bilayers put together.\
Picture for reference.

Now, there are pores on the nuclear envelope for the passage of materials between the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm.\
A protein structure called the *'pore complex'*, or NPC(Nuclear pore complex) for short, lines the pore and regulates the materials that are passed.\

- *Nulcear lamina*
    - Mechanical suport for nucleus by fibrillar network
    - regulates DNA replication and cell division
    - anchors the NPCs

Chromosomes are made from condensed DNA. The condensation is made possible by chromatin.

#### The Nucleolus
Chromosomes, when not dividing, exists in a diffused state, thus difficult to distinguish from one another.\
The *nucleolus* is the most prominent structure in this diffused, not dividing state.\

In the nucleolus, *rRNA(ribosomal RNA)* is synthesized. Then the sub-units of ribosomes are assembled from the synthesized rRNA within the nucleus.\
These sub-units are then transported outside the nucleus, and then made into ribosomes.

### Ribosome
Ribosomes synthesize proteins.\

There are free ribosomes and bound ribosomes.\
Free ribosomes within cytosol and bound ribosomes attached to the ER(Endoplasmic Reticulum)(소포체) or nuclear envelope.

### Endomembrane System
These are some of the organelles that are included in the endomembrane system.
- Nuclear envelope
- ER
- Golgi apparatus
- Lysosome
- Vesicles
- Vacuoles
- Plasma membrane  

#### ER
The ER consists of a network of cisternae and is in direct contact with the nuclear envelope.\
The inside of the ER is called the ER lumen.\

The ER is divided into 2 types, the smooth ER and the rough ER.\
Rough ER has ribosomes stuck to the outside of the membrane, which gives it its rough texture.\
The smooth ER on the other hand, has no ribosomes on the outside of the membrane.

##### ***Role of Smooth ER***
- plays part in lipid synthesis
- metabolism of carbohydrates
- detoxification of poison by attaching hydroxyl groups to the poison, making it more soluble
- storage/exertion of calcium ions; depending on the situation

##### ***Role of Rough ER***
- sythesize protein: polypeptide chains are made from bound ribosomes; polypeptide chains are synthesized while entering the ER lumen. They are transported from the ER to other parts of the cells via transport vesicles.
- makes membranes and phospholipids: phospholipids are synthesized by precurosrs that exist in the cytosol. Then membranes and phospholipids are transported to where it's needed via transport vesicles.
