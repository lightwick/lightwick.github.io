> organic: compounds containing carbon

*Organic chemistry* is the field in which organic compounds are dealt with.\
## Why is carbon important?
> Valence: the number of covalent bonds an element can form.\
> e.g. H = 1, O = 2, N = 3, C = 4

An atoms' valence is generally the number of electrons it needs to complete the valence shell. Carbon has 4 valence electrons, 4 short from completing the valence shell. By sharing 4 electrons with other atoms, it can fill its valence shell. In other words the valence of carbon is 4.

### Hydrocarbon
> Hydrocarbon: molecules only containing carbon(C) and hydrogen(H)

Hydrocarbons are considered non-polar due to the relative non-polarity of the bond between carbon and hydrogen.\
Due to hydrocarbons' non-polarity, they are hydrophobic.
