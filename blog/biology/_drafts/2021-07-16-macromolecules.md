## 1. Macromolecules
#### Macromolecules are defined as large molecules. In biology macromolecules referes to carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nuleic acids.

‚Äª Because the term large molecules is ambiguous, what it refers to differs by literature.

Macromolecules are polymers. Polymers are made from monomers forming covalent bonds.
> monomer + monomer ‚áÑ polymer + H2O

Monomers, output an H2O molecule as they form a covalent bond and create a polymer. Therefore this reaction is called a __dehydration reaction__.
This reaction may also be called __polymerization__.\
The opposite reaction is called __hydrolysis__.

## 2. Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates are sugars. The most basic form of sugar is __monosaccharides__. Sugars such as disaccharides and polysaccharides are derived from monosaccharides. Let's take a look at them from the most basic, to the most complicated.
### 2-1) Monosaccharides
- Monosaccharides: consists of a carbonyl group(CùÑóO), and multiple hydroxyl groups(ùÑñOH)
There are a couple characteristics that identify a monosaccharide.
1. location of the carboxyl group(CùÑóO):
    - aldose: contains aldehyde group(‚àíCHO)
    - ketose: containes ketone gropu(R‚ÇÇC=O), where R is a carbon containing substituent.
2. Number of carbons in the (carbon) skeleton:
    - 6 carbon skeleton: hexoses
    - 5 carbon skeleton: pentoses
    - 3 carbon skeleton: trioses
From the above, we can say glucose(C‚ÇÜH‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇO‚ÇÜ) is a hexoses and a aldose.
### 2-2) Disaccharides
Disaccharides, as the name suggests, consists of two monosaccharides forming a glycosidic linkage, which is a covalent bond formed by a dehydration reaction.
### 2-3) Polysaccharides
Polysaccharides that have hundreds to thousands of monosaccharides joined together by glycosidic linkages.\
Polysaccharides are also polymers. The monomer of these polymers are disaccharides such as glucose, fructose, mannose and galactose.\
There are many different uses of polysaccharides, two of which are for storing energy and the other for maintaining the structure.
#### 1. Storage Polysaccharide
Both plants and animals use polysaccharides to store energy, while the polymer in use may be different.\

 Plants use starch to store energy. Starch is a glucose made polymer. They are stored in plastids such as chloroplasts.\
 Animals use glycogen. Glycogen is also a polymer of glucose. Glycogen in vertebrates are mostly stored in liver and muscle cells.
 
Both plants and animals use polymers that are made from glucose, starch(amylose, amylopectin) and glycogen respectively.\
While amylopectin(form of starch) is very similar to glycogen, in that both have 1-6 linkages at the branch points, glycogen is much more effective when storing energy due to its more extensive forming of branches.\
Energy is stored by the synthesis of polymers such as the aforementioned starch or glycogen, which happens when there is access energy left within the organism.\
Now how about when energy is depleted within an organism and needs energy.\
The opposite reaction, hydrolysis, occurs, fueling the organism.
#### 2. Structural Polysaccharide
Cellulose is a glucose polymer, used in the cell wall of plant cells. What gives cellulose its toughness is the structure that cellulose forms.\
There is Œ± glucose(starch) and Œ≤ glucose(cellulose). Œ± glucose forms a helical structure.\
Œ≤ glucose forms a linear structure. Glucose monomers form hydrogen bond with hydroxyls from other cellulose molecules that lie parallel to it. This is possible due to the linear structure that cellulose forms. This interconnected hydrogen bond forms what is called a microfibril.
‚ÄªOn an unrelated note, cellulose while non-digestive in humans(due tot the lack of enzymes to break down cellulose), it stimulates teh secretion of mucus which helps the digestion process of other food intake.
