## 1. Macromolecules
#### Macromolecules are defined as large molecules. In biology macromolecules referes to carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nuleic acids.

※ Because the term large molecules is ambiguous, what it refers to differs by literature.

Macromolecules are polymers. Polymers are made from monomers forming covalent bonds.
> monomer + monomer ⇄ polymer + H2O

Monomers, output an H2O molecule as they form a covalent bond and create a polymer. Therefore this reaction is called a __dehydration reaction__.
This reaction may also be called __polymerization__.\
The opposite reaction is called __hydrolysis__.

## 2. Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates are sugars. The most basic form of sugar is __monosaccharides__. Sugars such as disaccharides and polysaccharides are derived from monosaccharides. Let's take a look at them from the most basic, to the most complicated.
### 2-1) Monosaccharides
- Monosaccharides: consists of a carbonyl group(C𝄗O), and multiple hydroxyl groups(𝄖OH)
There are a couple characteristics that identify a monosaccharide.
1. location of the carboxyl group(C𝄗O):
    - aldose: contains aldehyde group(−CHO)
    - ketose: containes ketone gropu(R₂C=O), where R is a carbon containing substituent.
2. Number of carbons in the (carbon) skeleton:
    - 6 carbon skeleton: hexoses
    - 5 carbon skeleton: pentoses
    - 3 carbon skeleton: trioses
From the above, we can say glucose(C₆H₁₂O₆) is a hexoses and a aldose.
### 2-2) Disaccharides
Disaccharides, as the name suggests, consists of two monosaccharides forming a glycosidic linkage, which is a covalent bond formed by a dehydration reaction.
### 2-3) Polysaccharides
Polysaccharides that have hundreds to thousands of monosaccharides joined together by glycosidic linkages.\
Polysaccharides are also polymers. The monomer of these polymers are disaccharides such as glucose, fructose, mannose and galactose.\
There are many different uses of polysaccharides, two of which are for storing energy and the other for maintaining the structure.
#### 1. Storage Polysaccharide
Both plants and animals use polysaccharides to store energy, while the polymer in use may be different.\

 Plants use starch to store energy. Starch is a glucose made polymer. They are stored in plastids such as chloroplasts.\
 Animals use glycogen. Glycogen is also a polymer of glucose. Glycogen in vertebrates are mostly stored in liver and muscle cells.
 
Both plants and animals use polymers that are made from glucose, starch(amylose, amylopectin) and glycogen respectively.\
While amylopectin(form of starch) is very similar to glycogen, in that both have 1-6 linkages at the branch points, glycogen is much more effective when storing energy due to its more extensive forming of branches.\
Energy is stored by the synthesis of polymers such as the aforementioned starch or glycogen, which happens when there is access energy left within the organism.\
Now how about when energy is depleted within an organism and needs energy.\
The opposite reaction, hydrolysis, occurs, fueling the organism.
#### 2. Structural Polysaccharide
Cellulose is a glucose polymer, used in the cell wall of plant cells. What gives cellulose its toughness is the structure that cellulose forms.\
There is α glucose(starch) and β glucose(cellulose). α glucose forms a helical structure.\
β glucose forms a linear structure. Glucose monomers form hydrogen bond with hydroxyls from other cellulose molecules that lie parallel to it. This is possible due to the linear structure that cellulose forms. This interconnected hydrogen bond forms what is called a microfibril.
※On an unrelated note, cellulose while non-digestive in humans(due tot the lack of enzymes to break down cellulose), it stimulates teh secretion of mucus which helps the digestion process of other food intake.
### 3. Lipids
Lipids are hydrophobic due to it consisting of mostly hardocarbons regions. \
∵ Hydrocarbons are non-polar becuase the electronegativity of hydrogen and carbon aren't big enough.\
There are 3 important lipids in biology.
1. Fats
2. Phospholipids
3. Steroids
#### 3-1) Fats
Fats are made from glycerol and fatty acids. Three fatty acids are linked to the glycerol to make fat.\
The glycerol is referred to as the 'head', and the fatty acids as the 'tail'.\
The linkage between the glycerol and fatty acids is called an ester linkage. Ester linkage is basically a hydration between the hydroxyl group(𝄖OH) of the glycerol and the carboxyl group(C𝄗O) of the fatty acids.\
Fats can also be classified into two. Saturated fat and unsaturated fat.
##### 1. Saturated fat
When there are only single bonds between the carbons in the carbon chain(skeleton), that molecule is called a saturated fat.\
Because there are only single bonds in the carbon chain, it is relatively flexible in its structure, which allows it to pack together tightly.\
Due to this, alot of saturated fats can remain solid at room temperature. e.g. Butter, lard, etc..
##### 2. Unsaturated fat
When one or more double bonds are in a carbon chain, that molecule is called an unsaturated fat.\

Unsaturated fat can be again divided into 2 categories, cis fat and trans fat.(C𝄗O)

In *cis* fat, The *cis* double bond causes the fatty acid to become bent, preventing it from it and other molecules like it from being close to each other.\
They are mostly liquid at room temperature. e.g. Fish oil, live oil, etc..

*Trans* fat has a linear structure compared to cis fat. Trans fat is common in processed foods. Trans fat is considered bad to human health. Further more, the FDA ordered trans fats to be removed from the US food supply. Not only the US, but Denmark and Switzerland has also banned trans fats in foods.

The main use of fats is to store access energy. In mammals energy is stored in adipose cells (translated to 지방세포 in Korean).
#### 3-2) Phospholipids (인지질)
Phospholipids are very similar in structure to fats. The only difference is that only two fatty acids are connected to glycerol, and a __phosphate group molecule__ is connected to the top of the glycerol(considering the head as the top and tail as the bottom).\
The phosphate group has a negative electrical charge, giving the head of the phospholipid slightly polar, making it hydrophilic, while the tail remains hydrophobic.\
Now this characteristic creates what is referred to as a bilayer, where the heads of the phospholipids face outwards of the bilayer and the tail face inwards.

#### 3-3) Steroids
The carbon skeleton of sterods is different from phosphlipids and fats. In steroids the four carbons create a ring like shape.\
Steroids controls membrane fluidity. It is also used as a signaling molecule.\
Cholesterol is an important steroid in animals. It is the precursor to other steroids such as sex hormones. Cholestrol is synthesized in the liver.
### 4. Proteins.
