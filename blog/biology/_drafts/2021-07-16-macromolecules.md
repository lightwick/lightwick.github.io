## 1. Macromolecules
#### Macromolecules are defined as large molecules. In biology macromolecules referes to carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nuleic acids.

※ Because the term large molecules is ambiguous, what it refers to differs by literature.

Macromolecules are polymers. Polymers are made from monomers forming covalent bonds.
> monomer + monomer ⇄ polymer + H2O

Monomers, output an H2O molecule as they form a covalent bond and create a polymer. Therefore this reaction is called a __dehydration reaction__, or __hydrolysis__.
This reaction may also be called __polymerization__.
