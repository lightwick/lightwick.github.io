Water played a huge role in what we call life. It's only natural we explore what makes it so.
## 1. Properties of Water
The properties I'll discuss mainly comes from one thing, hydrogen bond. This hydrogen bond has one-twentieth the strength of a covalent bond.
### 1-1) Cohesion - 응집력
Molecules are linked together by multiple hydrogen bonds, which pulls on each other, creating a more structured state.
### 1-2) Adhesion - 부착력
This is the clinging of one substance to another. This is due to water being polar, easily sticking to other polar molecules.
### 1-3) Surface Tension - 표면장력
Water has high surface tension.\
This is due to the aforementioned cohesive property of water. Water molecules pull on each other, creating a so-called link, while the air does not.
### 1-4) Specific Heat - 비열
> Definition: Energy needed to increase the temperature of 1g of a substance by 1°C

Water has high specific heat, meaning it takes a lot of energy to increase the temperature,
eventually meaning the substance can hold a lot of energy. This can help moderate the air temperature.

## 2. Water as a Solvant
The definitions are as follows.
- solvent: the dissolving agent e.g. water
- solute: the dissolved substance e.g. NaCl (salt)
- solution: a mixture of two or more substances where the composition is uniform throughout the mixture

As an example, let's say we dissolve the solute, salt, in the solvent, water.
1. Salt(NaCl) is divided into Na+ and Cl-.
2. The partially negative oxygen of water is attracted to the cation, which is Na+, while the hydrogen is attracted to the anion, Cl-.
3. Water molecules surround the ion molecules, thus creating a 'hydration shell'.
This is how a solute gets dissolved in a solvent. 
The key to being dissolved in water like solvents is being a polarized molecule, ergo, if a molecule of a certain substance has polar regions and is polarized, it can be a solute,
given that the molecule is small enough.
What do I mean by that?

Cotton is hydrophilic meaning it's attracted to water. cf)The opposite of this is hydrophobic\
And yet, cotton does not dissolve in water, as you can see that towels do not dissolve when met with water.\
This is because the molecules consisting of cotton, cellulose, are too big to be dissolved.

## 3. Measurable Properties of Solutions (Molarity, pH)
### 3-1) Molarity
6.02*10^23 is Avogadro's Number.\
1 mol(mole) of a substance is 6.02*10^23 molecules of it.\
6.02*10^23 Da ≈ 1g\
> 1 mol of a substance of molecular mass 1 Da = 1g\
> 1 mol of a substance of molecular mass α Da = αg

Molarity:
> α M(molarity) = α mol solute in 1L of water

### 3-2) pH - acidity
> pH = -log[H+]\
> *[H+]: molarity of H+*

- base: substance that increases hydrogen ion(H+) concentration
    - weak base: NH3 + H+ ⇄ NH4+
    - strong base: NaOH → Na+ + OH-
- acid: substance that decreases hydrogen ion(H+) concentration
    - strong acid: HCl → H+ + Cl-
Weak bases and weak acids have a reaction that mostly go both ways.\
In strong bases and strong acids, the reaction mostly goes in one direction.

## 4. Buffer
> H2CO3 ⇄ HCO3- + H+

There being a acid-base pair, the access of H+ induces reverse reaction decreasing H+ concentration and vice versa.\
In blood there are multiple substances contributing to being the buffer, ergo even if substances that would normally drastically change the pH of a solvent were to be added to blood there wouldn't be much of a drastic change as would other solvents.
