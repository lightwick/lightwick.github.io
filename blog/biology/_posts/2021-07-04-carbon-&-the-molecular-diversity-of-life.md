> organic: compounds containing carbon

*Organic chemistry* is the field in which organic compounds are dealt with.
## Why is carbon important?
> Valence: the number of covalent bonds an element can form.\
> e.g. H = 1, O = 2, N = 3, C = 4

An atoms' valence is generally the number of electrons it needs to complete the valence shell. Carbon has 4 valence electrons, 4 short from completing the valence shell. By sharing 4 electrons with other atoms, it can fill its valence shell. In other words the valence of carbon is 4.

### Hydrocarbon
> Hydrocarbon: molecules only containing carbon(C) and hydrogen(H)

Hydrocarbons are considered non-polar due to the relative non-polarity of the bond between carbon and hydrogen.\
Due to hydrocarbons' non-polarity, they are hydrophobic.

## Isomers
> isomer = iso(equal) + meros(a share) â†’ isomeres

![isomer word origin](/assets/isomer_word_origin.png)

- isomer: while isomers have the same chemical compositions, their properties differ due to their differences in structure. These are the three types of isomers.
    1. structural isomer: refer to image below
    2. cis-trans isomer: cis(on this side of), trans(across) are the latin-english correspondents. Cis isomer would have the same atom on the same side, and trans vice versa
    3. enantiomers: They are divided into L isomer and D isomer. The letters used to tell apart enantiomers, L and D, are from the words _'levo'_ and _'dextro'_ which mean _'left'_ and _'right'_ respectively.

## ATP
ATP(Adenosine triphosphate)

ATP is the main source of energy inside all animals. How ATP is used will be discussed further down the line.
