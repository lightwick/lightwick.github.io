### Next time: Page 50~75

I want to use this as a preface to what I'll be blogging about in this category which is *'biology'*.\
This is basically a summary plus my take, basically the thoughts that have emerged, on the material I've learned while reading/studying *'Campbell Biology 7th ed'*.

### 1. Hypothesis and Theory, the differences
Hypothesis - 가설\
Theory - 이론\
*Basically, theory is a more generalized hypothesis.*

### 2. Organisms
Cells are divided into 2 subcategories, the prokaryotic cell(원핵세포) and the eukaryotic cell(진핵세포).\
Prokaryote: pro(before) - karuon(kernel) - -ote
Eukaryote: eu(easy) - karuon(kernel) - -ote

| Organism | Subcategories                                                   | Cell Type   |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Eukarya  | Kingdom Plantae<br>Kingdom Fungi<br>Kingdom Animalia<br>protist | Eukaryotic  |
| Bacteria | -                                                               | Prokaryotic |
| Archaea  | -                                                               | Prokaryotic |
