Biology is the product of chemistry and physics, ergo basic knowledge of them are crucial to understanding biology.

## 1. The Building Blocks

Elements
There are 90~94 naturally occuring elements. Humans need 25 of them, and plants need 17 to survive. Let's look at humans. Over 96% of the human body consists of the following.
- Oxygen (O) - 65.0%
- Carbon (C) - 18.5%
- Hydrogen (H) - 9.5%
- Nitrogen (N) - 3.3%
The other elements, while small in composition rate, is essential for proper growth and nourishment of our bodies. We call these essential elements, 'Essential trace elements'.
The word 'trace element' can have different meaning throughout different literature.
### Trace Element
- Biochemistry: Having a concentration smaller than 100ppm or 100μg
- Geochemistry: Having a concentration smaller than 1,000ppm or 0.1% of a rock's composition.

## 2. Subatomic Particles
> The three subatomic particles:\
> Proton, Neutron, Electron

| Particles | Mass(Da) | Mass(kg)      |
|-----------|----------|---------------|
| Proton    | ≈1Da     | ≈1.7*10^(-27) |
| Neutron   | ≈1Da     | ≈1.7*10^(-27) |
| Electron  | ≈0.55mDa | ≈9.1*10^(-31) |
- mass number: (Number of protons) + (Number of neutron)
- atomic number: number of protons
- atomic mass: average mass of all the existing isotopes an element
*One thing to note here is, because protons' and neutrons' mass aren't exactly 1Da(dalton), the atomic mass of an element does not equal to the mass number(while unit in dalton)*
Isotopes are atoms that have different number of neutron, yet having the same number of protons.

A radioactive isotope is where an atom is going through a decay of the nucleus, and during the decay the atom can lose protons, ergo changing the element.\
Half life is the time it takes for 50% of the parent isotope to decay. The half life isn't affected by external environmental factors.
Through the analysis of the atoms, with the knowledge of the half life of the isotope found, we can determine how long a certain material has been. This is called radiometric dating.

### Energy in atoms
The energy in atoms are from potential energy of the electron.\
More energy -> higher potential energy of electron; electron being further away from the nucleus.\
The electrons' energy is quantized, meaning it has fixed energy levels of which it can have. This is the shell of the atom.\

The outer most shell is the *_valence shell_*.\
The electrons in the valence shell are teh *_valence electrons_*.\
Chemical behavior is determined by the valence electrons.\
Valence shell = complete/full → inert, checmically unreactive; stable

### The Chemical Bonds
- Covalent Bond: atoms sharing electron(s), due to the stability of having complete valence shells.
- Ionic Bond: Positive charge(cation) and negative charge(anion) attract to each other and creates chemical bond

*_More on ionic bonds_*
- Water weakens ionic bonds, due to the atoms interacting with the water molecules
- Atoms with ionic bonds are not molecules. i.e. NaCl(Not a molecule)

### Weak Interaction
- Hydrogen Bond: hydrogen covalent bond with electronegative atom, attracts to other eletronegative atoms. e.g. Hydrogen in H2O attracted to Nitrogen in NH3
- van der Waals interaction: interaction when atoms and molecules are very close by

### Orbitals
Orbitals: places electrons are found 90% of the times.
