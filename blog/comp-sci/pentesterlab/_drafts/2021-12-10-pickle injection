title: Python Pickle Code Injection
---

Pickle is used for (de)seralization of objects. Unpickling unknown or arbitrary objects can lead to malicious code being executed.
```
import pickle

class foo(object):
  def __reduce__(self):
    return (os.system, ("[command] [argument]",))
    
malicious_pickle = pickle.dumps(foo())
```

Unpickling the `malicious_pickle` mentioned in the code would result in the execution of such arbitrary code.\
While not a security flaw, it is something that can be exploited if not used careful.
