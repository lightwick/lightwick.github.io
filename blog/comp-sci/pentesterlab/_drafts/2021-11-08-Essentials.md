## SQL
By default SQL will ignore trailing spaces. Also SQL is not case sensitive.
i.e. "Admin " and "admin" are the same

## Server Response
If the response code is `3xx`(redirection) or `201`(created), and the `Location` response header exists, the page is redirected to where the `Location` header specifies.

## file format
There might be useful information in json or js format. It can be accessed via formatting the `accept` header or by messing with the url.

## Mass-Assignment
adding attributes to submitting data. e.g. `user[admin]=true`
