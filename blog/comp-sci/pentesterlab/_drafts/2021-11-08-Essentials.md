## SQL
By default SQL will ignore trailing spaces. Also SQL is not case sensitive.
i.e. "Admin " and "admin" are the same

## Server Response
If the response code is `3xx`(redirection) or `201`(created), and the `Location` response header exists, the page is redirected to where the `Location` header specifies.

## file format
There might be useful information in json or js format. It can be accessed via formatting the `accept` header or by messing with the url.

## Mass-Assignment
adding attributes to submitting data. e.g. `user[admin]=true`
Let's say there is an attribute like 'organisation'. Ids might be assigned rather than the string of the name of the organization, i.e. `organisation_id`.

## Remote Code Execution / Code Injection

### php

### Ruby
참고:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6338908/ruby-difference-between-exec-system-and-x-or-backticks
In ruby, backticks can be used for code injection e.g. \`uname\`

Ruby comments are #.
One thing to note is, in url, + are just another way of expressing space.
To write + in html url, you must write the hexidecimal version of it which is `%2b`

### Python
`os.system()` or   `os.popen().read()` can be used.
#### importing
`__import__('os').system('ls')` or `__import__('os').popen('ls').read()`

#### bypassing restrictions for inserting certain characters directly
Indirectly pass strings on by encoding the string in something like *base64* and decode the thing within the code injection.
e.g. `__import__('base64').b64decode(LOCALLY_INCODED_STRING)`
