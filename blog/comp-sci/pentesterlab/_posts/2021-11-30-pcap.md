## Wireshark methods
```
tcp.stream == [specified stream number chronically]
tcp.port == [specified port number]
```
`==` can be replaced with `eq`

## Protocol that Needs to be Learned
1. FTP
2. RSH
3. Telnet
4. SSH
5. Rlogin

### SMTP
An email can be referred to as an eml file.\
The attachment of an email can be decoded by the command `uudecode` or from an eml file client.

## transaction id
`dns.id == 0` can be used to check for 'transaction id's that are set to 0, which is very dangerous.

## Unanswered Questions
1. What is transaction ID and how is it safe? What prevents it from being forged?
2. What is SNI and how is it used?
