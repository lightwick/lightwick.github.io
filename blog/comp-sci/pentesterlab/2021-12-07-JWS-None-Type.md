title: JWT None Algorithm Injection
---

JWT(JSON Web Token) is a standard for issuing tokens for verification.

JWT is formatted like the following
> `base64([HEADER] + '.' + [PAYLOAD] + '.' + [SIGNATURE])`

Instance of a header and a payload are `{"alg":"None","typ":"JWS"}'` and `{"login":"admin","iat":"1638798345"}` respectively.\
There are multiple algorithms that can be used, one of which is `None` which is mostly used for debugging.\
While the `None` algorithm is used, the signature is not required for authentication.

One of the security measure that can be done one the server side is disabling it completely.
