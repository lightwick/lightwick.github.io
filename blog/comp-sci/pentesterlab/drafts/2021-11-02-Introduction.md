- command1 || command2 that will run command2 if command1 fails.
- command1 ; command2 that will run command1 then command2.
- command1 | command2 that will run command1 and send the output of command1 to command2.; *referred to as pipelining*

## Unix
### Bash
- uses `.bash_history` to store previous commands.
- `.bashrc` is loaded on start
- `.bash_profile` gets loaded when users log in via console
 
### find command
`find dir -name fileName`

You need to specify an action that needs to be done after `find`, the default being `-print`
`-exec` would execute commands on the result of `find`.

`find dir -name fileName -exec grep **[regex]** {} \;`

### tar zip/unzip files
`tar -xvzf fileName`
`tar -cvzf fileName`
- -x: extract
- -c: create tar file
- -v: verbose

- -f: fileName specified next

### su command
