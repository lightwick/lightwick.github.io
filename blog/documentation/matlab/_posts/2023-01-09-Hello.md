# Loop
## For
```
for iteration=0:1:10  % equivalent to 0:10 (inclusive)
    disp(iteration)
end
```
This prints from 0 to 10, inclusive

## While
```
n = 10;
while n<=10
    disp(n)
    n=n+1;
end
```

# Conditional Statements
## if, elseif, else
The following code is self-explantory
```
a = 1;
if a==1
    a = 2
else if a==2
    a = 1
else
    a = 0
end
disp(a)
```
## Arithmetic
`.^` Element-wise power

## misc
1. `;` suppresses output.
2.`~=`: matlab equivalent of `!=`
3. `scatterplot(qammod(x, M))`
