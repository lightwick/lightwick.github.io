  Hello World!
</p>

This is my tech blog, where I organize and write about the things I've learned! I'm pretty excited to be starting this journey into the unknown.

Here is my [previous blog](https://blog.naver.com/kevin991125). (Migration incoming)

## Compare two #
### Here are the things that I'll do to improve this site (to-do list):
* Set project page, where a page leads to posts of the project.
* Automate the above with jekyll liquids
* migrate and organize posts from [previous blog](https://blog.naver.com/kevin991125)
* Set up link to mail, github etc..
* Set up commenting
* Maybe, set kor/eng language selection
* Blog on process of setting up github pages in lanyon
* Set up so opening sidebar doesn't affect the whole page
* Optimize [pagination](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/variables/#paginator) to my liking
* set color for b tags or h3 tags #1a5490; for increased readability; [reference hyperlink](https://life-with-coding.tistory.com/403)
* show posts as summarized version; because it makes no sense really to see the whole post when you have a specific post you want to see in mind
* create seperate layout for codeforces blogging; separate folder for problem in html form, added in post via post layout

### Projects
* Project Weed-wacker
    * add read books section
    * daily tasks section. e.g. Things I said I'll do everyday, like biology and leetcode
### Various Questions I have:
* What is [Atom](https://atom.io/) and how can it benefit me?

### Things to study:
* How do I use [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)?

Thanks for reading!
