  Hello World!
</p>

This is my tech blog, where I organize and write about the things I've learned! I'm pretty excited to be starting this journey into the unknown.

Here is my [previous blog](https://blog.naver.com/kevin991125). (Migration incoming)

### Here are the things that I'll do to improve this site (to-do list):
* Set project page, where a page leads to posts of the project.
* Automate the above with jekyll liquids
* migrate and organize posts from [previous blog](https://blog.naver.com/kevin991125)
* Set up link to mail, github etc..
* Set up commenting
* Maybe, set kor/eng language selection
* Blog on process of setting up github pages in lanyon
* Set up so opening sidebar doesn't affect the whole page
* Optimize [pagination](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/variables/#paginator) to my liking

### Various Questions I have:
* What is [Atom](https://atom.io/) and how can it benefit me?

### Things to study:
* How do I use [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)?

Thanks for reading!
